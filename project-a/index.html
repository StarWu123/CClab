                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>The Dream Catcher is a shapeshifting creature with a soft, fur-like body that also has a slime-like texture, allowing it to mold and flow like a liquid. Instead of eyes. At its center, it can open a black hole-like void that pulls in "dream fuel" for nourishment.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> When digesting, its body shifts through colors, briefly flickering with energy as it processes the dreams it consumes.</li>
                    <li> it uses two pointy, antenna-like sensors to feel its surroundings.</li>
                    <li>Likes to stay in dark moist corners of rooms.</li>
                    <li>Without dream fuel the creature warps into itself and turns into dust.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

        <div class="one-column">

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about [Dream Catcher]?</span>
                This creature does not to be in contact with any object or species, and will avoid contact by shifting its body to avoid touch. Also, this creature cannot reproduce and from observation is formed from dust particles gathered over a long period of time. Without dream fuel the creature warps into itself and turns into dust.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Staying out of contact with the creature and providing dreams to feed the creature at night. Providing different dream fuels will get different reactions from the creature. To give the creature different experiences, generate different room setups from the experiment labs controls.
